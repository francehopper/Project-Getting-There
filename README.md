Project-Getting-There
=====================
A project to build a web interface for fetching SEPTA sechedules using the Stop ID.

About the Project
=====================
This project seeks to build a web interface to retreive schedules for SEPTA by using a Stop ID number.
The application fetches schedules using the SEPTA API by providing the Stop ID, desired route, and desired number
of results as input.
The inspiration for this project was the SMS schedule system.

Future Plans
=====================
Automatically fetch routes associated with a stop in a dropdown.
Allow fetching the next arrivials for all routes at a stop instead of one at a time.
Figure out why requesting three results doesn't always fetch three results
[Nice-to-have] responsive layout.
[Nice-to-have] fetch any associated route disruptions.
